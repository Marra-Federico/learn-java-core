# Java Classes (Interfaces, abstract classes)

## Interfaces

### Motivation

![](./images/intro-typical-calling-tree.avif)

```java
// Concrete Keyboard class
class Keyboard {
    public void useKeyboard() {
        System.out.println("Keyboard in use...");
    }
}

// Concrete Monitor class
class Monitor {
    public void useMonitor() {
        System.out.println("Monitor in use...");
    }
}

// Computer class directly depends on specific implementations
class Computer {
    private Keyboard keyboard;
    private Monitor monitor;

    public Computer(Keyboard keyboard, Monitor monitor) {
        this.keyboard = keyboard;
        this.monitor = monitor;
    }

    public void useKeyboard() {
        keyboard.useKeyboard();
    }

    public void useMonitor() {
        monitor.useMonitor();
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate tight coupling
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Keyboard keyboard = new Keyboard();
        Monitor monitor = new Monitor();

        Computer computer = new Computer(keyboard, monitor);
        computer.useKeyboard();  // Output: Keyboard in use...
        computer.useMonitor();   // Output: Monitor in use...
    }
}
```

**Limitations of This Approach**

1. **Tight Coupling**:
    - If we want to use a different type of keyboard (e.g., a **WirelessKeyboard**), we **must modify the `Computer` class** to support it.
    - If a third-party library provides a new `TouchScreen`, we'd have to modify `Computer` again.

3. **No Common Abstraction**:
    - `Keyboard` and `Monitor` have no shared abstraction, meaning **we cannot treat all peripherals generically**.
    - The `Computer` class must know about **every specific peripheral type**.

4. **Redundant Code**:
    - If we add more peripherals, we'd need to create separate methods like `useMouse()`, `usePrinter()`, etc., leading to **code duplication**.

**Using interfaces for decoupling the design**
   
```java
// Keyboard interface - Defines keyboard-specific behavior
interface Keyboard {
    void useKeyboard();
}

// Monitor interface - Defines monitor-specific behavior
interface Monitor {
    void useMonitor();
}

// Concrete implementation of a Mechanical Keyboard
class MechanicalKeyboard implements Keyboard {
    @Override
    public void useKeyboard() {
        System.out.println("Typing on a mechanical keyboard...");
    }
}

// Concrete implementation of an LED Monitor
class LEDMonitor implements Monitor {
    @Override
    public void disuseMonitorplay() {
        System.out.println("Displaying on an LED monitor...");
    }
}

// Computer class depends on the interfaces, not concrete implementations
class Computer {
    private Keyboard keyboard;
    private Monitor monitor;

    public Computer(Keyboard keyboard, Monitor monitor) {
        this.keyboard = keyboard;
        this.monitor = monitor;
    }

    public void useKeyboard() {
        keyboard.useKeyboard();
    }

    public void useMonitor() {
        monitor.useMonitor();
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate decoupling
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Keyboard keyboard = new MechanicalKeyboard();
        Monitor monitor = new LEDMonitor();

        Computer computer = new Computer(keyboard, monitor);

        computer.useKeyboard();  // Output: Typing on a mechanical keyboard...
        computer.useMonitor();   // Output: Displaying on an LED monitor...
    }
}
```

**How This Approach Helps**

1. **Decoupling**:
    - `Computer` depends on the `Keyboard` and `Monitor` interfaces, **not on specific implementations**.
    - We can easily swap in a **WirelessKeyboard** or **OLEDMonitor** without modifying `Computer`.

2. **Better Extensibility**:
    - We can add new keyboard and monitor types (e.g., `TouchscreenMonitor`, `GamingKeyboard`) **without modifying existing classes**.


### Declaring interfaces
An interface can be considered a special kind of class that can't be instantiated. To declare an interface, you should use the keyword `interface` instead of `class`. Key points:

* Interfaces cannot have constructors (no instantiation). 
* Methods in an interface are implicitly **public** and **abstract**.


```java
interface Mouse {
    public static final int K = 0; 

    void click();

    void doubleclick();
}
```


### Implementing and extending multiple interfaces

An interface can extend one or more other interfaces using the keyword `extends`:

```java
interface A { }
interface B { }
interface C { }

interface E extends A, B, C { }
```

A class can extend only one class and implement multiple interfaces:

```java
class A { }

interface B { }
interface C { }

class D extends A implements B, C { }
```

Multiple interfaces are often used in the standard library. The class String, for example, implements three interfaces at once:

```java
public final class String implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence {
    // ...
}
```

### Marker interfaces

In some situations, an interface has no members at all. Such interfaces are called **marker** or **tagged interfaces**. For example, a well-known interface `Serializable` is a marker interface:

```java
public interface Serializable {
    
}
```

Other examples of marker interfaces are `Cloneable`, `Remote`, etc. They are used to provide essential information to the JVM.



### Methods with a body
#### Static methods

You can declare and implement a static method in an interface

```java
interface Car {
    static final double kmhToMph = 0.62;
    
    static double convertToMilesPerHour(double kmh) {
        return kmhToMph * kmh;
    }
    // ...
}
```

To use a static method you just need to invoke it directly from an interface

```
Car.convertToMilesPerHour(4.5);
```

The main purpose of interface static methods is to define utility functionality that is common for all classes implementing the interface. They help to avoid code duplication.



#### Default methods
**Interface methods are abstract by default**. One kind of method can have a body nevertheless. Such methods are called `default` and are available since Java 8.

```java
interface Feature {
    default void action() {
        System.out.println("Default action");
    }
}
```

Although default methods are implemented, you cannot invoke them directly from an interface like `Feature.action()`. You still need to have an object of a class that implements the interface:

```java
class FeatureImpl implements Feature {
    // ...
}
```

```
Feature feature = new FeatureImpl();
feature.action(); // Default action
```

If you want to customize a default method in a class, just override it like a regular method:

```java
class FeatureImpl implements Feature {
    public void action() {
        System.out.println("FeatureImpl-specific action");
    }
}
```

```
Feature feature = new FeatureImpl();
feature.action(); // FeatureImpl-specific action
```

Sometimes default methods are huge. To make it possible to decompose such methods, Java allows declaring private methods inside an interface:

```java
interface Feature {
    default void action() {
        String answer = subAction();
        System.out.println(answer);
    }

    private String subAction() {
        return "Default action";
    }
}
```

#### Why are they needed?
The main idea of an interface is declaring functionality. Default methods extend that idea. They don't just declare functionality but also implement it. **The main reason is supporting backward compatibility**. Let's consider an example.

Suppose you program a game that has several types of characters. These characters are able to move within a map. That is represented by the `Movable` interface:

```java
interface Movable {
    void stepForward();
    void stepBackward();
    void turnLeft();
    void turnRight();
}
```

So we have the interface and many classes that implement it. For example, `Batman`, `Robin`, `Joker` characters:

```java
class Batman implements Movable {
    public void stepForward() { /*...*/ }
    public void stepBackward() { /*...*/ }
    public void turnLeft() { /*...*/ }
    public void turnRight() {/*...*/ }
}
```

Then you decide that characters should be able to turn around. That means you need to add the `turnAround` method to the `Movable` interface **and implement the method for all classes implementing the interface** (if those classes are a lot this could become very time-consuming!). 

Another way is declaring a `default` method in the interface. Then you don't have to implement it in all classes.

```java
interface Movable {
    void stepForward();
    void stepBackward();
    void turnLeft();
    void turnRight();
    default void turnAround() {
        turnLeft();
        turnRight();
    }
}
```

## Abstract classes

An **abstract class** is a class declared with the keyword **`abstract`**. It represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses. Abstract classes have some special features:

-   it's impossible to create an instance of an abstract class;
-   it can contain abstract methods (implemented in non-abstract subclasses);
-   it can contain non-abstract methods;
-   an abstract class can extend another class, including an abstract one;
-   it can contain a constructor.

As you can see, an abstract class has two main differences from regular (concrete) classes: no instances and abstract methods.

**Abstract methods** are declared by adding the keyword **`abstract`**. They have a declaration (modifiers, a return type, and a signature) but don't have an implementation. Each concrete (non-abstract) subclass must implement these methods.

Note, static methods can't be abstract!

```java
import java.awt.*;

public abstract class DrawingTool {

    protected Color color;

    protected DrawingTool(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    protected Color getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    protected void setColor(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public abstract String draw(); // an abstract method
}
```

The class has a field, a constructor, two non-abstract methods and an abstract method.

Since `DrawingTool` is an abstract class we cannot create instances of this class:

```java
DrawingTool pencil = new DrawingTool(Color.RED); // this throws a compile time error
```

The method `draw()` is declared abstract because, at this level of abstraction, its implementation is unknown. Concrete subclasses of the class `DrawingTool` should have an implementation of this method.

```java
class Pencil extends DrawingTool {

    // It can have additional fields as well

    public Pencil(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    public String draw(Curve curve) {
        return "Pencil drawing a " + curve.draw();
    }
}
```


```java
class Brush extends DrawingTool {

    // It can have additional fields as well

    public Pencil(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    public String draw(Curve curve) {
        return "Brush drawing a " + curve.draw();
    }
}
```

**Abstract classes** and **interfaces** are both tools to achieve abstraction that allow us to declare abstract methods. We cannot create instances of abstract classes and interfaces directly, we can only do that through classes that inherit them.

Since Java 8, an interface can have default and static methods that contain an implementation. It makes interface more similar to an abstract class. So, the important question is: what is the difference between interfaces and abstract classes?

```mermaid
classDiagram
class Interface {
    <<interface>>
    
}

class AbstractClass {
    <<abstract>>
}
class ConcreteClass1 

class ConcreteClass2

AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass1
AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass2
Interface <|.. AbstractClass
```

## Using abstract classes and interfaces together

Often interfaces and abstract classes are used together to make a class hierarchy more flexible. In this case, an abstract class contains common members and implements one or multiple interfaces, and concrete classes extend the abstract class and possibly implement other interfaces.

```java
interface DrawingTool {
    String draw(Curve curve);
}
```


```java
abstract class AbstractDrawingTool implements DrawingTool {
    protected Color color;

    protected AbstractDrawingTool(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    protected Color getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    protected void setColor(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public abstract String draw(); // an abstract method
}
```

```java
class Pencil extends AbstractDrawingTool {

    // It can have additional fields as well

    public Pencil(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    public String draw(Curve curve) {
        return "Pencil drawing a " + curve.draw();
    }
}
```

```java
class Brush extends AbstractDrawingTool {

    // It can have additional fields as well

    public Pencil(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    public String draw(Curve curve) {
        return "Brush drawing a " + curve.draw();
    }
}
```

Using both concepts (interfaces and abstract classes) makes your code more flexible. Use suitable abstractions or their combination when designing your class hierarchies.

As an example, you may see class hierarchies in the standard Java class library. An example of that is the collections' hierarchy. It combines abstract classes and interfaces to make the hierarchy more maintainable and flexible to use in your code.

 ## Anonymous classes

Java provides a mechanism for creating a class in a single statement without having to declare a new named class. Such classes are called **anonymous** because they don't have name identifiers.

Let's assume we have the following interface with two methods:

```java
interface SpeakingEntity {

    void sayHello();

    void sayBye();
}
```

Here is an anonymous class that represents an English-speaking person:

```java
SpeakingEntity englishSpeakingPerson = new SpeakingEntity() {

    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Bye!");
    }
};
```

The anonymous class is declared and instantiated at the same time as an expression. It overrides both methods of the interface.

We assign an instance of the **anonymous class** to the variable of the interface type. Now, we can invoke overridden methods:

```
englishSpeakingPerson.sayHello();
englishSpeakingPerson.sayBye();
```

Let's declare and instantiate another anonymous class:

```java
SpeakingEntity cat = new SpeakingEntity() {

    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
};
```

So, `englishSpeakingPerson` and `cat` are instances of different anonymous classes that implement the same interface.


 ## Nested classes
You can call a class **nested** when it is declared inside another class.

```mermaid
classDiagram

class NestedClass 

class NonStaticNestedClass
class StaticNestedClass

class InnerClass
class LocalInnerClass
class AnonymousInnerClass

NestedClass <|-- NonStaticNestedClass
NestedClass <|-- StaticNestedClass
NonStaticNestedClass <|-- InnerClass
NonStaticNestedClass <|-- LocalInnerClass
NonStaticNestedClass <|-- AnonymousInnerClass
```

### Inner classes
Imagine that you are writing a class `Cat` representing cats. Let's say you want a cat to have a bow. Then you need to create a new class `Bow`. This class `Bow` would be quite small and specific, and you know you won't need a bow without a cat. The solution is to create the class `Bow` inside the `Cat` class:

```java
public class Cat {

    private String name;

    public Cat(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public class Bow {
        String color;

        public Bow(String color) {
            this.color = color;
        }

        public void printColor() {
            System.out.println("Cat " + Cat.this.name + " has a " + this.color + " bow.");
        }
    }
}
```

Let's create a cat `Bob` with a red bow:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Cat cat = new Cat("Bob");
        Cat.Bow bow = cat.new Bow("red");

        bow.printColor();
    }
}
```

```text
Cat Bob has a red bow.
```

#### Scope of the inner class

Now let's discuss what we can see from the inner class and who can access the inner class from outside.

```java
public class Cat {

    private String name;

    public Cat(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    private void sayMeow() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " says: \"Meow\".");
    }

    public class Bow {
        String color;

        public Bow(String color) {
            this.color = color;
        }

        public void putOnABow() {
            Cat.this.sayMeow();
            System.out.println("Bow is on!");
        }

        public void printColor() {
            System.out.println("Cat " + Cat.this.name + " has a " + this.color + " bow.\n");
        }
    }
}
```

From inside the inner class, we can see all methods and fields of the outer class even if they are `private`. And don't forget that we can use everything else according to access modifiers as well.

An inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class. So to instantiate an inner class and get access to it, you need to instantiate the outer class first:

```java
Outer outer = new Outer();
Outer.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
```

Remember about access modifiers **:** if you make an inner class `private`, then it can only be accessed from inside the outer class. The same works for fields and methods.



### Static nested classes

Imagine, that one day you woke up and decided to draw. Obviously, you would do so with the help of some Java code. Your ultimate goal is to draw a painting. But how to create a masterpiece? That'll require doing some sketches first.

How would you organize your code? It's a good idea to use a nested class here. But if you choose to employ an inner class then a `Sketch` would only exist if the `Painting` was instantiated previously. So, we'd prefer something different. And the **static nested class** is going to help us.

It allows us to create a `Sketch` first, and then, only if you're ready to become an author of a masterpiece, you can create a `Painting`.

```java
public class Painting {

    private String name;

    public static class Sketch {

        private int id;

        public Sketch(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public void drawSketch() {
            drawForest();
            drawBear();
        }

        private void drawForest() {
             System.out.println("Forest was drawn in a sketch!");
        }

        private void drawBear() {
            System.out.println("Bear was drawn in a sketch!");
        }
    }
}
```

Let's try it:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Painting.Sketch sketch = new Painting.Sketch(0);

        sketch.drawSketch();
    }
}
```

Greetings to our bear in a forest!

```text
Forest was drawn in a sketch!
Bear was drawn in a sketch!
```

 #### Scope of a static nested class

Let's modify our example a little bit with `Sketch` and `Painting` and talk about their scope.

```java
public class Painting {

    private String name;

    private static double length;
    private static double width;

    public static void setLength(double length) {
        Painting.length = length;
    }

    public static void setWidth(double width) {
        Painting.width = width;
    }

    public static class Sketch {

        private int id;

        public Sketch(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public void drawSketch() {
            drawForest();
            drawBear();
        }

        private void drawForest() {
            if (Painting.length > 5 && Painting.width > 3) {
                System.out.println("Big forest was drawn in a sketch!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Small forest was drawn in a sketch!");
            }
        }

        private void drawBear() {
            System.out.println("Bear was drawn in a sketch!");
        }
    }
}
```

We've added two `static` fields to the `Painting` class, namely `length` and `width`. And we've also added a condition to the method `drawForest` of the class `Sketch`.

With setters, we decide what sizes our `Painting` will be and then use that information inside the method `drawForest`.

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Painting.setLength(10);
        Painting.setWidth(7);

        Painting.Sketch sketch = new Painting.Sketch(1);
        sketch.drawSketch();
    }
}
```

And here is a big forest with a bear:

```text
Big forest was drawn in a sketch!
Bear was drawn in a sketch!
```

So, we've got access to`private static` fields from a static nested class!

And is there anything that we can't see? Yes, instance variables and methods of an outer class, including the field `name` in our example.

From the outside everything works as usual: we create an instance of a static nested class and good luck! Just mind the syntax:

```java
OuterClass.NestedClass nested = new OuterClass.NestedClass();
```

Remember about access modifiers **:** if you make a static nested class `private`, then it can only be accessed inside the outer class. The same works with fields and methods.

 ### Local inner class

In real life, you won't face local inner classes often, but it is worth knowing how to use them if you want to be a proper programmer.

You can define a local inner class *inside any block*. But, usually, local inner classes are defined inside a method body.\
Let's move to an example now:

```java
public class Outer {

    private int number = 10;

    void someMethod() {

        class LocalInner {

            private void print() {
                System.out.println("number = " + Outer.this.number);
            }
        }

        LocalInner inner = new LocalInner();
        inner.print();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.someMethod();
    }
}
```

Here we have an outer class `Outer` and a method `someMethod` in it. We define our local inner class inside `someMethod` and we also create an instance of `LocalInner` there.

Have you noticed that our class `LocalInner` *doesn't have* an access modifier? And it can't!

There are other restrictions. Inside a local inner class you *cannot* define any static members, enums or interfaces.

 #### Scope of a Local Inner class

The scope of the local inner class is restricted to its containing block, which is `someMethod` in our example.

```java
public class Outer {

    private int number = 10;

    void someMethod() {
        final int x = 5;

        class Inner {
            private void print() {
                System.out.println("x = " + x);
                System.out.println("number = " + Outer.this.number);
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.print();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.someMethod();
    }
}
```

What can we see inside the local inner class? Members of the outer class, including the field `number`. And local variables of the enclosing block, such as void `someMethod`. Local variables must be declared as `final` or be effectively final, the latter means their value is never changed after initialization and there's no need for the keyword `final`.

Remember, a local inner class can be instantiated only *within the block* where the inner class is defined.\
So other parts of the code *don't know* that it exists.
